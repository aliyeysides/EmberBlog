## Ember Blog using the ESK
Using the ember-starter-kit to create a front-end, heavy client-side, responsive and fast performing web blog.
In this blog I will showcase my resume, add my writing, and display the projects I've worked on in the past.

## Ember-Data
I will not be using ember-data for this repo because I wanted to wireframe before introducing data persistence. I will create another repo that will incorporate Rails as the JSON API along with the same front-end design found in this repo. 

## Front-End CSS
For the front-end I will be using Brent Jackson's OOCSS library, BaseCSS.
